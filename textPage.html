	<h1><strong>The Secret To Reversing Type II Diabetes</strong> HIDDEN Within This Small Vietnamese Village</h1></div>

<strong><em>"If you want your wife to live&hellip; you have to sign here and agree to surgery&hellip;</em></strong><br>
<strong><em>But, we have to do this as soon as possible."</em></strong>
</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is John Stevens and in the next few minutes I&rsquo;m going to tell you about the worst day of my family&rsquo;s life&hellip;</p>
<p>An experience that I hope nobody ever gets to experience.</p>
<p>Why am I sharing this with you?</p>
<p>Because even though I nearly lost my wife on that day, that terrifying experience led me on a journey <strong>that uncovered a type 2 diabetes remedy</strong> that&rsquo;s been used for centuries by the Vietnamese, and can effortlessly lower your blood sugar almost overnight, no matter if you&rsquo;ve been struggling with this horrible disease for one month or 30 years.</p>
<p>Moreoverâ€¦ I will show you the strange morning ritual that allowed my wife and countless of other people fight type 2 diabetes and improve their overall health, without having to pay obscene amounts of money on toxic pills, doctor visits, insulin shots and test stripes EVER AGAIN.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not all&hellip;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll also discover the infuriating reason why this natural trick has been kept away from your eyes for all this time&hellip; even if it&rsquo;s the simple, natural, fastest and most affordable way to lower your blood sugar levels in just a few days weeks, without changing your lifestyle or any help from greedy doctors and toxic pills.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you, or someone you know, suffers from type II diabetes, you&rsquo;ve probably tried everything else and have been let down again and again by the people who are supposed to help us&hellip;</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;ve probably been told the same shameless LIES that my wife has heard from her doctor:</p>
<p><strong>First, that there is no escaping type II diabetes.</strong></p>
<p>When instead, there is no escaping their pills and insulin pumps.</p>
<p>They want you to think that you are beyond repair&hellip; But that is completely wrong.</p>
<p>My wife and thousands of other people have experienced incredible results with this natural method and efficiently manage their type 2 diabetes!</p>
<p>All of them lowered their blood sugar levels and got rid of the fatigue, blurred vision and pain&hellip; even after the doctors they went to insisted that there was no other way!</p>
<p>Later, I also discovered the shameless scams that the $350 billion-dollar Diabetes Industry uses to keep you in the dark and actually KEEP you sick for the rest of your life, so they could get more money in their pockets&hellip;</p>
<p>When my wife went to her first doctor appointment, he told us that she&rsquo;d have to take Metformin and go on a diet for the rest of her life&hellip; That her life depended on it every minute of every day and that that was &lsquo;normal&rsquo; for her condition.</p>
<p>And we believed him.</p>
<p>She had those pills in every purse and would take them regularly, even though they gave her some nasty side effects.</p>
<p>Now those pills are forgotten history because she doesn&rsquo;t need them ever again, thanks to the Vietnamese morning ritual that gave her back her life and lowered her glucose levels in just a few weeks.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;ll show you how even though this natural method comes from a community that has never used technology in their lives&hellip;</p>
<p>There is research and scientific proof made by the same greedy pharma companies proving that this formula works.</p>
<p>Yet&hellip;</p>
<p class="headline"><strong>No doctor is ever going to offer you this revolutionary treatment because they&rsquo;ll be out of job.</strong></p>
<p>They refuse to publish this powerful and game-changing remedy &ndash; because a healthy client is a client lost and that is not good for business.</p>
<p>So, I don&rsquo;t know for how long I can keep this page live on the internet.</p>
<p>Even as you are seeing it, there are lawyers and hackers threatening us and trying to take this video down.</p>
<p><strong>The good news is that this means that this natural blood sugar remedy is the real deal and it&rsquo;s starting to cut on their profits.</strong></p>
<p>The bad news is that they are doing everything in their power to keep YOU from seeing this free presentation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So, please&hellip;</p>
<p>Watch this video now, while it&rsquo;s still up.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t leave it for later or tomorrow because this page with the formula and all the proof might not be here then&hellip;</p>
<p>And you risk never finding out about the method that thousands of people used to break the shackles that type 2 diabetes has put on your lives.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s some of the messages I receive every day:</p>
<p>John from Washington says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No wander they want to shut you up. I watched your video and tried the formula. In less than 2 weeks my blood sugars dropped to perfection. I&rsquo;m off insulin pumps, finally! Thank you for sharing this&hellip; and I hope you keep spreading the word so more and more people find out about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mary from Oklahoma says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow. Your video is the most amazing thing I have seen in my life! I must admit that I was a bit skeptical at first&hellip; I have heard before about &lsquo;miracle solutions&rsquo; but always ended up disappointed. I&rsquo;m so glad I decided to give it a try&hellip; because in 3 short weeks I was free of type 2 diabetes. It&rsquo;s mind-blowing how this thing works to treat the real cause of type II diabetes and not just the symptoms.&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is exactly why I made this video &ndash; to tell people that there is a way out!</p>
<p>To tell people about the real cause of type II diabetes and how they can lower their blood sugars fast and naturally, without spending their life savings on toxic pills and pumps.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I wish I&rsquo;d knows that type 2 diabetes has nothing to do with your pancreas, or how much sweets or carbs you eat&hellip;</p>
<p>That it has nothing to do with your diet, age, sex, health status, weight or genetics&hellip;</p>
<p>And as shocking as this may sound&hellip; it's actually all due to a hidden and yet highly dangerous process occurring in your brain&hellip;</p>
<p>A process that prevents your body's ability to maintain normal blood sugar levels and ultimately causes irrevocable damage to your overall health throughout your whole body.</p>
<p>I wish I&rsquo;d known about this when Mary started to fill sick, so she wouldn&rsquo;t have had to go through so much suffering and shame.</p>
<p>Just 2 years ago, I was in a hospital room, holding her hand and desperately trying to comfort her while she struggled between life and death.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Her symptoms started a 4-years prior to that horrible night.</p>
<p>It started with the uncontrollable cravings for chocolate and homemade ice cream.</p>
<p>Then Michelle began going to the bathroom more often and was always thirsty and tired while still expressing how her mouth seems to be dry all the time.</p>
<p>Initially, we thought that she was just worn out from working so much as a cashier during the holiday season.</p>
<p>Oh, how wrong we were at the time&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Because her health quickly took a dark turn for the worse.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>So, she decided it was time to see a doctor to figure out what's going on.</p>
<p>During the visit, her doctor performed several blood tests and the diagnosis was crystal clear&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Michelle had type 2 diabetes.</strong></p>
<p>At the time, we knew nothing about type 2 diabetes, let alone how to treat it. Preventing type 2 diabetes wasn't even something that registered on our radar in any way.</p>
<p>Which is why we put all our trust in modern medicine and doctors.</p>
<p>Immediately they put Michelle on Metformin to help with glucose management and promised that her health would improve.</p>
<p>So a week went by&hellip; then a month&hellip; then 12 more&hellip;</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t improving.</p>
<p>Instead she was feeling worse and worse every day.</p>
<p>She gained over 45 pounds&hellip; she had stomach pain and problems focusing on simple tasks&hellip;</p>
<p>The pain in her hands and feet became unbearable&hellip;</p>
<p>And if that wasn't enough, her blood pressure skyrocketed to almost uncontrollable levels.</p>
<p>When we went to a check-up, the doctor explained that this was normal and that "every drug has side effects".</p>
<p>But after seeing that Michelle was not willing to take them anymore&hellip;</p>
<p>He decided to switch her medication, prescribed Metformin Glyburide and promised that this would work.</p>
<p>Yet, it ended up giving Michelle new side effects like bloating, muscle aches and pains and kidney problems.</p>
<p>So we went back, and he prescribed other pills, the others.</p>
<p>But non of them worked.</p>
<p>The doctor lied to us and gave us false hope, AGAIN AND AGAIN.</p>
<p>And then&hellip; came THAT night.</p>
<p>I had just come back from a two-day shift and found Michelle in the kitchen trying to stand up.</p>
<p>She was white as a ghost and could barely catch a breath to tell me she had excruciating pain in her stomach.</p>
<p>I wanted to call an ambulance, but Michelle being headstrong as she is, said she doesn't need one.</p>
<p>As she started walking to our bedroom, she collapsed on the floor.</p>
<p>From there, everything got a little hazy&hellip;</p>
<p>I still don&rsquo;t know when or how I managed to call an ambulance, get her up and pack a bag.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the hospital, the doctors gave me the horrifying news -</p>
<p><strong>My wife had fallen into a deep type 2 diabetes coma.</strong></p>
<p>And once they did some tests, they told me that chances were she would never wake up again, and I was to prepare for the worst&hellip; to say goodbye to my person.</p>
<p>So imagine the horror on my face as I stayed there at her hospital bed, holding her hand and praying to God as hard as I could for her to live.</p>
<p>And when I thought that this was the worse that could happen to her&hellip;</p>
<p>Her surgeon pulled me aside one evening and told me that I had a choice and it could end up saving her life.</p>
<p></p>
<p align="center" class="headline"><strong><em>"If you want your wife to live&hellip; you have to sign here and agree to surgery&hellip;" said the doctor.<br></em></strong>
<strong><em>"But, we have to do this as soon as possible."</em></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>I was in complete and utter shock - I didn't know what to think or feel, let alone what I was going to choose to do for Michelle.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The doctor then explained that it was only by miracle that Michelle had survived until now from the fall and the diabetic coma.</p>
<p>They discovered that her blood vessels were narrowing to the point where there would be no way to live with her foot still intact.</p>
<p>Her blood sugar had become a literal ticking time bomb that could explode at any moment and take her away from me forever.</p>
<p>So, I was forced to make a decision while watching as Michelle was connected and kept alive by machines.</p>
<p>I knew I didn't have much time left so, I had to do something and save her&hellip; before it was too late.</p>
<p>So that night, I found myself in front of my laptop, sitting next to her bed and searching for answers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was enraged and thinking why is it so easy for some people to naturally control their blood sugar no matter what they ate, and so hard for others, like Michelle?</p>
<p>Her body had literally turned against her.</p>
<p>But the answers didn&rsquo;t come from my laptop, instead they came from an old friend &ndash; Dave.</p>
<p>He came to visit Michelle and me at the hospital.</p>
<p>He had a similar experience - Dave's father died from type 2 diabetes complications when he was a teenager.</p>
<p>And then, to make things worse, he found out that he also had type 2 diabetes when he was in his early 30s.</p>
<p>He's also one of the people whose doctor promised that he would get better with prescribed medications&hellip;</p>
<p>And year after year, those promises never came true.</p>
<p>But this time he looked different since the last time I&rsquo;ve seen him.</p>
<p>He was happy and he looked healthy and joyful. He even lost a lot of weight.</p>
<p>He seemed like a new man, a free man.</p>
<p>Dave and I talked about Michelle&rsquo;s journey and how she got there...</p>
<p>Then, when I started telling him about her doctors and how they have failed us again and again with their pills&hellip; and how now their only solution was surgery and weren&rsquo;t looking for other safer ways&hellip;</p>
<p>I could see Dave&rsquo; face turning red&hellip;</p>
<p>Then, he interrupted me and started talking visibly annoyed&hellip;</p>
<p>He told me that when he worked for one of the top pharma companies in the country he got a firsthand experience of their greedy and shady practices.</p>
<p>This job gave him the ability to access every research paper, every type 2 diabetes discovery that was made and every single clinical trial they ever performed&hellip;</p>
<p>And he discovered <strong>the big lies that are so carefully protected</strong> that he could get into an incredible amount of trouble if his former company executives found out he was talking.</p>
<p align="center" class="headline"><strong>"This entire industry is corrupt to the bone", he said.</strong></p>
<p>From your initial diagnoses, your doctor's only job is to prescribe medications that will ultimately make your body build resistance to them overtime.</p>
<p>Then when your blood sugar goes up, as it will naturally do, their next job is to increase the dosage or prescribe even more drugs to counteract the ineffectiveness of the previous ones.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how so many people get stuck in this vicious, life-sucking cycle.</p>
<p>A never-ending cycle where you take a fistful of pills, yet your glucose levels are irregular, you feel tired all the time, feel pain in your muscles and joints, the constant dizziness and the kidney problems that lead to heart and liver problems.</p>
<p></p>
<p>He also told me that in April 2020, a class-action lawsuit was filed against Metformin in which they asked the FDA and the drug manufacturer to recall the drug from the market due to deadly side effects?</p>
<p><strong>It's true.</strong></p>
<p>But my guess is that your doctor never mentioned this to you.</p>
<p>He will never share this knowledge with you nor the dangerous side effects that come along with the medication&hellip;</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s because if they weren't prescribing this medication, they would be directly depriving themselves of a money source too good for Big Pharma to kill.</p>
<p>And if that wasn&rsquo;t enough&hellip;</p>
<p>There is more!</p>
<p>I have no doubt that ever since you were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, your doctor and everyone else around you kept telling you that you should start exercising because it is good for your health.</p>
<p>But there isn't a single person that will tell you exactly what happens to your blood sugar as you start exercising, is there?</p>
<p>Let me be the one that sheds some light on this for you.</p>
<p>As you work out, your body releases a stress hormone called cortisol.</p>
<p>Which then stimulates your liver to release glucose and raise your blood glucose levels <strong>- This will, over time, eventually make your body even more resistant to insulin.</strong></p>
<p>In a 2011 study published by the University of Alberta, it was shown that exercising in combination with Metformin did not actually lower blood sugar in type 2 diabetics.</p>
<p>The fact is that exercising may end up working for you for some time, but it will not get your blood sugar to healthy levels that will allow you to live a healthy, happy life.</p>
<p>Why is this?</p>
<p>Because to manage type 2 diabetes and significantly reduce all its symptoms, you must get down to the root cause and deal directly with that.</p>
<p><strong>And that direct cause is the damage to your brain's natural security system and defense mechanism called the blood-brain barrier.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>As you already know, type 2 diabetes takes hold when your body becomes resistant to insulin or when your pancreas cannot produce enough insulin to maintain normal blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>Over the last two decades, there have been many studies that show that actually <strong>the insulin imbalance starts in the brain, and not in the pancreas as you&rsquo;ve probably been told before.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>You see, insulin is critical to maintaining proper brain health and cognitive functions - The brain is the biggest glucose hog in your whole body.</p>
<p>In fact, your brain is the only organ that actually requires glucose to function. Every other part of your body, they claim, is able to run on fat if it has to.</p>
<p><strong>But not your brain. For your brain it's either glucose or bust.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>This is due to the synapses between neurons that are formed in your brain and require an extremely high amount of energy which, in turn, lead to an increased consumption of glucose.</p>
<p>Over these years of study, many have shown that insulin resistance starts in a part of your brain called the <strong>hypothalamus</strong>.</p>
<p>A place where there is an incredibly high density of insulin receptors functioning all day long for all of your life.</p>
<p>These receptors cannot receive the insulin signals and, as a result, cause your body metabolic disorders and <strong>ultimately lead to a blood sugar imbalance in your body.</strong></p>
<p>Still, even after decades of research, scientists are still uncertain why your insulin receptors are unable to actually receive the signals that should easily be transmitted to them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After so many different sets of independent research, you would think that someone would find the answer, right?</p>
<p>Well, fortunately, a team of scientists from the University of Washington did in fact take an outside-the-box approach to the treatment and ultimate prevention of type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Instead of choosing to focus on what occurs inside the brain, the followed the insulin signals all the way throughout your body.</p>
<p>And it was in these pathways that they discovered something truly astonishing&hellip;</p>
<p>They had proved that, in fact, your insulin receptors are not the real problem, but rather, it&rsquo;s something else that happens during the signaling process in your brain.</p>
<p></p>
<p align="center" class="headline"><strong>The secret to effectively fight type II diabetes from your life isn't inside your pancreas as your doctors will claim.</strong></p>
<p>It's actually inside this essential part of your brain that is meant to keep you safe, yet it ends up destroying your body from the inside out.</p>
<p>To put it in shorter terms -</p>
<p>Imagine that you're coming home from a night out with friends, and as usual, you want not to set off the burglar alarm.</p>
<p>So you enter your code to disarm it as usual.</p>
<p>But it doesn't work!</p>
<p>So, you try it again.</p>
<p>Nothing&hellip; and your alarm is blaring.</p>
<p>Try it again. And again. Same results.</p>
<p>You know you didn't change your code, so what in the heck is happening inside your house?!</p>
<p>It's as if your own home security system was using your very own fingerprint that you installed it with and still doesn't recognize who you are anymore.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is what is happening inside your <strong>blood-brain barrier</strong> and your body that is causing the uncontrollable blood sugar levels you're having and, ultimately, type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>So, your own home security system is denying you entry to the very thing that will keep you safe.</strong></p>
<p>This then turns your body into a place where it cannot sustain or normalize any normal blood sugar levels, and you end up with this horrible disease and its complications.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Do you know what the worst part is?... because yes, THIS is not the worst!</p>
<p>The worst part is that when your blood-brain barrier is damaged, not only are your glucose levels going haywire, but other equally frustrating and debilitating issues occur - such as brain fog, difficulty concentrating, chronic fatigue, headaches, migraines, obesity, and even problems sleeping.</p>
<p>Let me ask you this critical question&hellip;</p>
<p>Does any of this sound familiar to you?</p>
<p>Have you experiencing any of these symptoms recently?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Can you imagine the look on my face when Dave told me about this?</p>
<p>It's probably quite similar to the one you're experiencing right now yourself.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So he continued to tell me about other half a dozen more studies that corroborated this claim and, in fact, proved that the natural and legitimate cause of type 2 diabetes is your damaged blood-brain barrier and not your pancreas or your diet.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I thought that this was truly incredible information... but why haven&rsquo;t we been told about it before?</p>
<p>There wasn't one single doctor that talked about this with Michelle or me during our painful years waiting in the hospital night after night, treatment after treatment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But&hellip; why would they?</p>
<p>Greedy corporations and corrupt doctors are living off your sickness!</p>
<p>Think about it, though, they are being handsomely paid to prescribe medications that have loads of side effects&hellip;</p>
<p>And while you suffer more and more each day, they are on vacations on private beaches.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="headline"><strong>The Diabetes Trap is real and unfortunately it targets the people we love.</strong></p>
<p>From the second you receive your diagnosis, your body and your health is being sold to the highest bidder, and your doctor is all a part of the auction.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Think about it&hellip;</p>
<p>Why else would they constantly prescribe you the same side effect riddled treatments?</p>
<p>Because they are being handsomely rewarded for your debilitating health.</p>
<p>All of this, with a smile on their faces, &ldquo;comforting&rdquo; you with the knowledge that you will improve over time and maybe tackle type 2 diabetes along with the help of these &lsquo;scientifically advanced medications&rsquo;.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But when your type 2 diabetes takes a turn for the worse, your doctors will simply shrug their shoulders as if it's actually your fault that your body failed you.</p>
<p>And then guess what?</p>
<p>Yes, that's right - Prescribe you more meds to fix all those new and exciting problems you're experiencing daily.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It isn't new and shocking news that doctors, alongside the most prominent diabetes associations, have been taking handsome payouts from big pharma who manufacture insulin, Metformin, and other "state of the art" diabetes medication.</p>
<p>In 2005, the American Diabetes Association took $23 million from food manufactures and big pharma companies alone.</p>
<p align="center" class="headline"><strong>In 2012, the amount reached $31 million.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>The medical industry pays hundreds of millions each and every year to all the many diabetes protocols and groups to keep you sicker and dependent on their &lsquo;solutions&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Did you know that the average diabetic spends over $16,000 every year on their medical expenses?</p>
<p>This might sound harsh&hellip; but&hellip; <strong>you are one of the cash cows that is too fat and big for them to give up on.</strong></p>
<p>So they will continue to push anything and everything that's chemical-filled and provides even a glimpse of hope for a healthier existence, to make money from you and your suffering.</p>
<p>It's all one big, giant racket they've engineered at your expense.</p>
<p></p>
<p  class="headline"><strong>The good news is that there is a way out of that deadly rabbit hole.</strong></p>
<p>A way to override your system and step out of your suffering, depression, and illness.</p>
<p>Without changing your lifestyle&hellip;</p>
<p>And without having to take a hundred toxic pills every morning or do some special diet.</p>
<p>Now, you may be wondering what this amazing formula is and how can you get your hands on it?</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m getting ahead of myself&hellip; I&rsquo;ll tell you more about that in a few short minutes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As I sat there and listened to Dave and attempted to absorb all of this information for myself, I was finally starting to understand&hellip;</p>
<p>It was clear to me how all of Michelle's money-draining type 2 diabetes treatments, along with all of their horrible side effects, were expertly designed and engineered to keep you a prisoner in their life-sucking cycle.</p>
<p>It started to make sense why the entire pharmaceutical industry hasn't tried to find a healthy solution to type 2 diabetes&hellip;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Even why I was still sitting in the hospital by Michelle's bedside, watching as none of her doctors tried to help her break free from this disease &ndash; only propose  surger  and then a return to insulin.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But then, Dave delivered the happy news&hellip;</p>
<p  class="headline"><strong>There is a way to effectively fight type 2 diabetes for good by addressing the real cause of this disease and not only targeting symptoms.</strong></p>
<p>Fortunately, Dave was kind enough to allow me to record the rest of the conversation, so I don&rsquo;t miss out any key information.</p>
<p>Here is the transcript:</p>
<p>Dave: "Is this on?"</p>
<p>John: "Yes, please, continue."</p>
<p>Dave: "John, you need to understand that what happened to Michelle isn't her fault, no matter what the doctors have told you. Not long before this, the modern medicine we trust failed me as well.</p>
<p>I followed every single treatment and medication the doctors told me to and trusted that the pharmaceutical industry had my best interest at heart, but I was wrong. Doing everything they&rsquo;ve asked almost cost me everything I owned as I tried to pay for it all.</p>
<p>And yet, I found myself in a hospital bed, waiting to sign papers that would make me disabled for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>It was then that I decided I would not spend my life rolling around in a wheelchair.</p>
<p>I knew I had little time left, so I wanted to find a solution fast, not be stuck in a cold, sterile bed without legs.</p>
<p>Then I remembered that I&rsquo;ve read in one of the hidden trials that there was some kind of method in Asia, but the research was redacted or shredded to pieces.</p>
<p>So, I packed my bags and took the first plane out&hellip;</p>
<p>If there was indeed something there, I had to discover it for myself.</p>
<p>It shocked me by how welcoming those who lived there were.</p>
<p>I met with spiritual healers, tribal chiefs and even shamans.</p>
<p>I started to ask questions and ask for guidance to find the formula that I and millions of other people have been desperately searching ever since we&rsquo;ve been diagnosed with type II diabetes.</p>
<p>People kept whispering about a tiny place in the remote areas of Vietnam, where the wealthiest people in the world go to "age in reverse."</p>
<p>They would actually say that people who lived and visited those villages, would come back healthier and looking more youthful.</p>
<p>Talk about a fairy tale, right?!</p>
<p>So, I was very intrigued about what their secret was&hellip;</p>
<p>And ooh boy&hellip; did I discover it!</p>
<p>After going there and talked with the town elders for some time, they allowed me to try their healing formula.</p>
<p>The next day I felt like a new man &ndash; a healthier and happier man.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t in so much pain anymore and when I pricked my finger to see my glucose levels, they were lower than the day before.</p>
<p>I finally understood why the richest of the rich speak only in their own heavy guarded circles about these places.</p>
<p>I understood why the villagers were so proud of their healing formula and even more so why none of them had diseases - they never even heard of type 2 diabetes before.</p>
<p>"It's what keeps us healthy," they all kept repeating over and over to me.</p>
<p>As if it was their own slogan or motto.</p>
<p>But, legend had it that whoever drank this secret mixture would end up living a long and incredibly prosperous life.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When I heard this, I started to play a game with myself&hellip; wondering how much they would end up charging me for this secret concoction.</p>
<p>So to get ahead of the game, I offered them the last $30,000 I had left to my name at the time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>What happened next shook me to my very core&hellip;</p>
<p>The elders refused my money and said that the only thing they need is to pay the women who collect these plants, dry them and extract the ingredients.</p>
<p>Which, in reality, was simply pennies on the dollar.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I have to say. These villagers saved my life, John. When the villainy of the trillion-dollar pharmaceutical industry and their minion doctors left me to die hopelessly in a hospital bed, these villagers provided a glimpse of hope that I never thought would be possible!</p>
<p>And I am confident and have faith that it will save your wife, Michelle, too.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is the recipe, along with everything I have left from these Vietnamese villagers' life-altering mix.</p>
<p>I am now living a life  where I can better control my type 2 diabetes thanks to them&hellip; and I hope I can offer the same fate to Michelle as well.</p>
<p>Just make sure you that Michelle takes a half a spoon of the mixture with a large glass of water once a day."</p>
<p></p>
<p>So, he handed me the recipe and left the room.</p>
<p>This sounded to good to be true&hellip; but that day had been such a rollercoaster of emotions that ultimately led me to chose between surgery or a strange concoction.</p>
<p>So, of course, I chose the latter.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As started to researched every herb, fruit, plant, and mushroom on the list, and their benefits were astonishing.</p>
<p>All of these amazing ingredients were directly connected to countless studies and research papers that showed amazing benefits for the body.</p>
<p></p>
<p>They had the incredible power to repair and strengthen your blood-brain barrier and heal what every doctor you talk to says cannot be fixed.</p>
<p>It was the solution that will make your blood-brain barrier to allow insulin to travel to your brain and stabilize your blood sugars to normal, naturally and effortlessly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The list had three main ingredients.</p>
<p>The first is <strong>Ashwagandha</strong>, also known as winter cherry, an ancient medicinal herb containing amazing health benefits.</p>
<p>In 2015, a study showed that Ashwagandha was highly influential in lowering your blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>Then another lab test proved that it also dramatically improves insulin sensitivity in your muscle cells.</p>
<p>Ashwagandha is considered to be an adaptogen, meaning that it will help your body manage stress, fight anxiety and depression, and significantly boost brain function.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The second ingredient on the list was - <strong>Chamomile.</strong></p>
<p>During lab tests, Japanese scientists gave subjects chamomile extracts every day for three weeks while the control group received a placebo.</p>
<p>Afterward, the researchers discovered that the group that consumed chamomile <strong>had a significantly lower blood glucose level.</strong></p>
<p>Several studies also show that chamomile has the tremendous power to help suppress enzymes that are linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes complications like vision loss, kidney problems, and nerve damage.</p>
<p>Chamomile has also been shown to be incredibly effective in lowering your cholesterol and triglyceride levels.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And then came the third ingredient, <strong>Skullcap</strong>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>During a 2009 study, Skullcap actually improved the activity of antioxidant enzymes in the liver and lowered blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>This very same study also discovered that it could lower your cholesterol levels if you are a type 2 diabetic.</p>
<p>In another remarkable study made on Skullcap&rsquo;s properties published in 2017 showed that if you take it over the course of 4 weeks, it will lead to a decreased level of triglycerides and will help your weight loss.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As I researched the ingredients on Dave's list, I started to notice that all of them were incredibly rich in a powerful compound called <strong>GABA</strong>, or otherwise known as gamma-aminobutyric acid.</p>
<p>I came across a comprehensive research study published by the University of Toronto that showed how taking GABA actually results in reducing inflammation inside your pancreas.</p>
<p>This very same study also laid out how GABA neurotransmitters play a critical role in allowing the brain to be more receptive to insulin.</p>
<p>When you think about it, this is a critical step in helping your body regulate insulin levels and keep blood sugar under control.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I found even more lab tests that showed that taking GABA for even just six weeks actually helps with your chronic stress, anxiety, and even sleeping problems.</p>
<p>This is because GABA is actually calming your brain cells.</p>
<p>Over the course of a 2019 study, it was shown that people who had a high GABA level also displayed healthy blood sugar levels and that their type 2 diabetes was diminished.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>The list of ingredients contains a total of 17 robust and exotic plants that when mixed together form the ultimate anti-type 2 diabetes supplement.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>And the best part of it all was that the benefits don&rsquo;t stop at type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>They also support healthy arteries, a healthy and strong heart, joints, safe and effortless weight loss, and even bone strength.</p>
<p>I had stumbled across the holy grail of blood sugar balance, and I couldn't believe my eyes!</p>
<p></p>
<p>And yet, not one single doctor told us about these powerful ingredients.</p>
<p>Even though it would have saved my wife from her health complications.</p>
<p>And even though it will save you and million others from irregular blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>No, they are too preoccupied with prescribing medications filled with harmful toxic chemicals that are doing more harm than good.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now that I had the list, I only had one more thing to sort out&hellip; how could I possibly begin to get and combine all of these minerals, nutrients and vitamins in the most efficient, practical and cost-saving way?</p>
<p>I needed a plan.</p>
<p>I needed to find a way to get all these potent ingredients and put them together in a revolutionary way that would allow them to be easily stored and consumed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So, I asked for Dave's help again.</p>
<p>Together, we started searching for a company that would help us bring the necessary ingredients into the States in massive amounts so we could begin manufacturing.</p>
<p>We found that easy-to-swallow capsules were the best way to consume these blood sugar supplements.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dave knew from his experience that for the magic to work best, these fantastic ingredients must be combined in the proper order and correct quantities.</p>
<p>You would be shocked by how ignorant most of the companies we spoke with are when it comes to ensuring the end product is of the highest quality and purity.</p>
<p>Some even scolded us that we want &lsquo;exotic&rsquo; ingredients when instead they had cheaper alternatives made with chemicals that mimic the natural benefits the plants give.</p>
<p>But that was the last thing we wanted to do!</p>
<p>So, we found a small and discreet company that believed in our formula and wanted to help us manufacture them to share with the world.</p>
<p>The company we found is both FDA approved and GPM (Good Manufacturing Practices) certified to ensure the highest quality.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now, we needed to find someone with the proper medical background to help us develop the ultimate formula that efficiently fights type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>The great thing was that Dave already knew the best person for the job from his big pharma days.</p>
<p></p>
<p>His name was Dr. Scott Hanson, and he has over 40 years of medical experience.</p>
<p>He jumped on board right away, and the rest is history for us.</p>
<p>"Your findings are insanely accurate," Dr. Hanson said.</p>
<p>"To be perfectly honest, every year, doctors and researchers come into my lab and try to shed light on a study about insulin receptors, but then they simply disappear into the ether.</p>
<p>Big Pharma corporations have special departments dedicated to suppressing and hiding these amazing findings from the world," Dr. Hanson concluded.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But even though we knew the risk, we decided that the greater good was more important than their threats.</p>
<p>So, we started to work on the capsules.</p>
<p><strong>We combined old-school techniques with state-of-the-art technology to ensure that every capsule is powerful and delivers amazing health benefits!</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Hanson and his team worked tirelessly to deconstruct the ingredients into particular molecules and then expertly extracted the powerful nutrients they contained.</p>
<p>He perfected the formula by taking it even one step further...</p>
<p>He added <strong>Vitamin E</strong> to enhance and promote a more robust immune system, better vision, and even healthy skin.</p>
<p>Then <strong>Biotin</strong> to increase energy levels.</p>
<p><strong>Zinc</strong> for shaper memory and brain performance.</p>
<p>And for the final touch, he added <strong>yarrow flowers</strong> for excellent gut protection.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>It was indeed a one-of-a-kind masterpiece!</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Because the facility we chose to work with was already FDA approved, we didn't have to wait years of trials and approvals.</p>
<p>All we needed was one willing person to test it.</p>
<p>So, naturally I thought about Michelle.</p>
<p>She was already at home, trying to decide whether or not do the surgery&hellip;</p>
<p>So, when I told her she doesn&rsquo;t need to think about that but instead to take this capsule every day with a glass of water, she was skeptical.</p>
<p>Anyone would be.</p>
<p>Especially since every other type 2 diabetes supplement failed on its promise.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But, after a conversation with Dr. Hanson, she felt that it was worth a shot.</p>
<p>What else did we have to lose, really?</p>
<p>In the first couple of days nothing really happened, and I could tell she was starting to lose hope.</p>
<p><strong>After a week of the type II diabetes supplements, though, her blood sugar dropped from 280 down to 196, which immediately gave her hope for the first time since she has been diagnosed.</strong></p>
<p>A few more days passed, and when we checked again&hellip; she was down to 138!</p>
<p>And after a few weeks more, <strong>her blood sugar was down to 120.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Michelle continued to monitor her glucose levels carefully and noticed that a few times, they went up to 132.</p>
<p>She called Dr. Hanson and he told her that this was expected in the first weeks.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then, when she hit the 12-week mark, her blood sugar levels were finally down to a healthy 116&hellip;</p>
<p>And stayed that way consistently for days on end.</p>
<p><strong>No matter what she ate, from pizza to chocolate, her blood sugar levels never went above 116 again!</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>She found that she had more energy than she had in years&hellip;</p>
<p>Her stress and anxiety were completely eradicated&hellip;</p>
<p>And she even lost 30 pounds!</p>
<p>It was the most amazing feeling ever to see her come to life again and laugh and enjoy her life!</p>
<p></p>
<p>When her doctors reviewed her results, they called it a miracle.</p>
<p>It was something they had never seen before&hellip; where someone naturally lowers their blood sugars with strange plants.</p>
<p>Since then she is isn&rsquo;t confined by the pharmaceutical industry and their toxic, chemical-ridden diabetes medications.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>She wasn&rsquo;t afraid anymore because she was finally taking her life and health back into her own hands!</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Of course, as you can imagine, all I wanted to do is share this information with the entire world!</p>
<p>But Dr. Hanson reminded me that we needed to prove that the formula works for anyone before we publish it.</p>
<p>So we found people who were willing to give this revolutionary and innovative all-natural diabetic supplement a shot.</p>
<p>In less than a week, we found 97 volunteers, ranging from pre-diabetics to people who've suffered from being type 2 diabetics for 5, 10, and even 20 years.</p>
<p>Every participant received a 4-month supply of the formula, and after a few weeks, all of them reported a significant drop in their blood sugar levels.</p>
<p></p>
<p  class="headline"><strong>Dave's game-changing formula had worked for every single one of them without exception.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Many participants also reported losing weight, while seeing an increase in their energy levels, clearer vision, as well as reducing the pain in their arms and legs.</p>
<p><strong>All in all, in the end, 100% of the participants discovered how to manage their type 2 diabetes.</strong></p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>It means that our supplement has a 100% success rate!</p>
<p></p>
<p>So, it was time to spread the world and help as many people as possible efficiently fight and significantly reduce the symptoms of type 2 diabetes in a matter of a few short weeks!</p>
<p></p>
<p>We produced a small batch of bottles and we called it&hellip; <strong>Diabitx</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p class="bigTextHeadline"><strong>Diabitx is the only natural blend of ingredients that deals directly with the actual cause of your type 2 diabetes, allowing you to naturally lower your blood sugar and escape the clutches of this disease.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>We produce every capsule of Diabitx in our FDA-approved and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) facility using the most advanced, state-of-the-art technology and equipment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Diabitx is non-GMO and safe for everyone.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We can say for sure that after the tens of thousands of successful stories we've seen, that Diabitx is more potent than any diet or supplement in the world at preventing type 2 diabetes, without changing your life style or holding you back from eating your favorite foods.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>It will also rejuvenate your heart and arteries, improves your memory and focus, boosts your energy&hellip; and so much more!</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>And it takes less than a minute. Just take it once a day with a glass of water and you too can escape the nightmare that is type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So, are you ready to take control over your own life and health?</p>
<p>Then ask yourself this one question&hellip;</p>
<p>How much is a type II diabetes and stress-free life worth to you?</p>
<p></p>
<p>How much would you pay to no longer worry about health complications and conditions?</p>
<p>How much would you pay to escape the never-ending cycle of ineffective and toxic pills that you&rsquo;ve been fed all these years?</p>
<p></p>
<p>$100,000? $60,000? $6,000?</p>
<p>How much?</p>
<p>Once dr. Hanson saw the incredible success of this program, he recommended that we set our price point at a minimum of $997&hellip;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Michelle said a little less... around $400.</p>
<p>And given the fact that <strong>Diabitx</strong> has already transformed the lives of over 125,000 people from all over the world who would've paid anything for the freedom this formula provides, I was willing to ask for $400.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If it was about money, we would have taken the retail store approach, outsource our amazing formula to Big Pharma and let them sell it through their minions.</p>
<p>But that means bending the knee to the greedy corporations that might change this one of a kind formula and replace some of the potent ingredients with chemicals or less expensive compounds that will not offer the same quality and benefits.</p>
<p><strong>And that&rsquo;s a risk we are not willing to take!</strong></p>
<p>That's why I'll never ask for $997, $497, or anything close to that.</p>
<p></p>
<p>All we want to do is cover the costs of the ingredients and keep this website up and online for as long as we can.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Initially, we set the price at $99 per bottle, but since you've stayed to hear Michelle's story and how it's impacted the lives of so many, I want to sweeten the deal&hellip;</p>
<p></p>
<p>So today, on this page only, I'm offering an incredible deal where you can get a 30-day supply of <strong>Diabitx</strong> for a one-time fee of only <strong></strong>$69, nothing more!</p>
<p></p>
<p>After seeing the incredible results that Michelle and all the volunteers got after taking this formula, we concluded that a 90-day supply is the way to achieve the best and long lasting results you desire.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But ultimately the choice is yours&hellip;</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t tell you how to live your life&hellip; I don&rsquo;t work for the Big cats and I am not here to steal your hard worked money.</p>
<p>But I really don&rsquo;t want you to wake up, years from now and be angry with yourself that you didn&rsquo;t decide to give this formula a try, but instead you continued to be a cash cow that pays over $16k yearly on toxic pills.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Just take a look at some of the messages we receive every day from real people who have decided to try this incredible formula and changed their lives&hellip;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it was the end of the road for me. Nothing I tried seemed to work and it wasn&rsquo;t until I found this treatment that I finally was able to turn things around and gradually start to reclaim my life. I can&rsquo;t recommend it highly enough!&rdquo; &ndash; Hank, 63</p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a long-time type II Diabetes sufferer and I was sick of taking medication after medication. Once this came into my life, I couldn&rsquo;t believe the immediate relief I felt! Shame on Big Pharma for keeping this secret from anyone!&rdquo; &ndash; Molly, 52</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can be the next success story.</p>
<p>So, it's time to take life by the horns and live it the way you've always wanted.</p>
<p class="headline"><strong>No more limitations and shackles.</strong></p>
